Coxygen Global Universities Haskell Practice Projects

Welcome to my Coxygen Global Universities Haskell practice repository! This collection features a series of compact and targeted tasks aimed at helping me learn and master essential Haskell concepts â€” from basic syntax to type classes and functional programming techniques.

Contents
The repository is organized into chapters, each housed in its own folder or file, and each focusing on specific Haskell topics:

- HC1: Basic functions, function composition, and pure functions
- HC2: Type signatures, variables, infix vs. prefix notation
- HC3: Conditionals, guards, and let/where bindings
- HC4: Pattern matching, tuples, and list operations
- HC5: Higher-order functions, lambdas, and function composition
- HC6: Recursion, folds, and creating custom map and filter functions
- HC7: Type classes (e.g., Ord, Show, Read) and defining custom type classes
- HC8: Data Types, Synonyms, and Records
- HC9: Parametric Types and Recursion
- HC10: Custom Type Classes and Instances
- HC11: Simple I/O Programs
- HC12: Haskell Programs and Modules
- HC13: Working with Modules and Directories
- HC14: Cabal Projects and Advanced Features
- HC15: Exception and Error Handling
